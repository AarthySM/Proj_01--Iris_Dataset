## *Iris Dataset Analysis*

This project explores the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, to uncover insights and patterns among Iris species. The analysis includes:

- **Data Import**  : Loading and inspecting the dataset.
- **Sanity Checks** : Verifying the dataset's structure and handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics and feature distribution analysis.
- **Visualization** : Scatter plots, bar plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize relationships and species differentiation.

*Key Findings*: 
- Petal length and petal width are the most significant features for distinguishing Iris species.
- Visualizations reveal clear separations among species.

This analysis provides a foundation for further classification tasks and data-driven research.
